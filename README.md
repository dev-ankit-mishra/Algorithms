# 🧠 Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to a wide range of algorithmic problems implemented in **Java**. Problems are organized by categories such as Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Binary Search, and more.

Each category includes **10–15 handpicked problems**, mostly from **LeetCode**, and features clean, optimized, and well-documented Java solutions.
